    <h3>Karl</h3>
    <p>I'm the founder and lead developer at Unremarkable Games. I'm an old-school programmer who got tired of working in big tech and decided to quit and start a game studio. I handle the technical architecture, game design, and development. ChatGPT told me to tell you that I bring decades of software engineering experience, which makes me uniquely qualified to create exceptionally unremarkable games, but that sounded a little too corporate.</p>

    <h3>Roslyn</h3>
    <p>I'm the Associate Producer for Unremarkable Games, handling event coordination, minor game development, and basically everything Neon Labyrinth needs. While Karl focuses on developing new games and getting them through the initial launch, I take care of all the long-tail operations - keeping our existing games running smoothly and engaging with our community.</p>
