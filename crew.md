## The Crew
Right now, Unremarkable Games is a solo crew (just me) with my wife helping out with some management and community tasks.

- **Karl**: An old-school programmer who got tired of working in big tech, so he quit and started a game company.
- **Mary**: The wife of the old-school programmer. She ensures we actually ship a game. She also likes people, so you will see her a lot on social media.
