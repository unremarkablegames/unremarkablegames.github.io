## Games
I don't need to spy on you to make a fun game. I don't want to spy on you either - it's weird.

I don't knowingly collect your information. What does that mean? I try _really_ hard not to collect _anything_.
Some of my games use Unity, and that engine has a lot of aggressive tracking features that are on by default.
I try to turn it all off, but some tracking may occasionally slip through. That isn't my intent. When I find something that
slips through, I turn it off and delete the dataset if I can.

The following is specific legal wording that is required to launch games on certain platforms:
* Do your games include third-party analytics? No.
* Do your games include third-party advertising? No.
* Do your games share data with any third parties? No.
* Do your games collect any user or device data for purposes beyond third-party analytics or third-party advertising? No.
