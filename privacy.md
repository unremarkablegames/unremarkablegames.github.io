# Games
I don't need to spy on you to make a fun game. I don't want to spy on you either. 

I don't knowingly collect your information and I try hard not to. Some of my games use Unity, and that engine has a lot
of agressive tracking features that are on by default. I try to turn it all off, but if some tracking slips though, it
isn't my intent. I am just an individual and I do what I can. Just let me know. I will delete what I can from the
collected dataset and push a release to turn it off.
