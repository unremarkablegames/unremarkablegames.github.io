# Project Management Plan

We are currently in the PRE-PRODUCTION phase.

## Development Schedule

This will probably get moved somewhere else, but my plan is to split development and management/business tasks across days. The idea here is to not let my creative brain get bogged down with mundane things, like bills.

The other concern I have is the amount of work needed to build a game. I will be required to find a balanced unbalance to get this done in the timeframe I have.

| DAY       | ACTIVITY                                                          |
|:----------|:------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Monday    | Half day reserved for business and management tasks (bills, etc.) |
|           | Write and send weekly Substack update                             |
| Tuesday   | Development                                                       |
| Wednesday | Development                                                       |
| Thursday  | Development                                                       |
| Friday    | Development                                                       |
| Saturday  | Development                                                       |
| Sunday    | Off                                                               |
