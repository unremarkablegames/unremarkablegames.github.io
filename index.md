Unremarkable Games is a 100% independent game studio based in Minnesota, United States. Right now, it is a solo shop.
I develop and publish my own games in my own way. I like things unremarkable and I hope you do to.

One of the things that makes my games unremarkable is that there will never be any adds or microtransactions. Ever.
I don't like that monetization model. If the game is free, then it's free. If you pay for one of my games, then
you get the game.

We also don't track you. Some of our games use Unity and that engine has a lot of tracking features that are on by
default. I try to turn it all off, but if some tracking slips though, it isn't my intent. Let me know. I will delete
the dataset and fix the game. I don't need to spy on you to make a fun game.
