Unremarkable Games is a 100% independent game studio based in the United States. We develop and publish our own games in our own way.

## The Crew
Right now, Unremarkable Games is a solo crew (just me) with my wife helping out with some management and community tasks.

- **Karl McClendon**: An old-school programmer who got tired of working in big tech, so he quit and started a game company.
- **Mary McClendon**: The wife of the old-school programmer. She ensures we actually ship a game. She also likes people, so you will see her a lot on social media.

Sign up for our weekly update on [Substack](https://unremarkablegames.substack.com), then head over to 
[Itch.io](https://unremarkablegames.itch.io/neon-labyrinth) to play our most recent build. Join the conversation and 
tell us what you think on Facebook. 

If you like the game, help fund it! You can head over to the store and buy some merch (coming soon) or you can send us a 
couple of bucks on Ko-fi (coming soon). Don't forget to follow us on your favorite social platform and spread the word. 
If we aren't on your preferred platform, email us (coming soon) and let us know where the cool kids are hanging out 
these days.

If you want to see behind the curtain, we publish most of our design documents and plans in our [dev](/dev.md) section.
Give them a read, then head over to Facebook and drop a comment, insight, or idea.
