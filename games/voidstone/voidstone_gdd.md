## Story Overview
### Backstory
*Of the Making of Ardenia and the Fall of Nyxara*

In the days before days, there came Elora. She was the Worldseed, gift of the Creator to the barren sphere that would become Ardenia. Upon the moment of her arrival, she performed the Great Shattering, breaking herself into a thousand upon thousands of pieces, that beauty might rise from sacrifice. As pieces of Elora fell to the ground, life sprang forth from the barren rocks.

Yet mark this well: not all of Elora was spent in that primordial sundering.

The mightiest shards of her being awakened to thought and will, becoming the Celestials—those who would shepherd the young world through its first turnings. Three orders arose among them, each according to their portion of power: First, the Primarchs, who hold dominion. Second, the Shapers, who wrought mountain and valley, river and sea, giving form to the formless. Last came the Guardians, gentlest and most beloved, who walked the world as teachers and protectors.

From the lesser fragments—motes of divine essence scattered like seeds upon the cosmic wind—came forth the Great Beasts, full of power and intelligence. Dragons took wing in the high places, their scales glittering with stolen starlight. Krakens descended to the uttermost depths, where pressure and darkness reign absolute. Phoenix and behemoth, basilisk and leviathan—each a fragment made flesh, each bearing a spark of the original fire.

Now it happened that Nyxara, counted among the wisest of the Guardians, turned her gaze to mysteries best left unexamined. She delved into the spaces between spaces, the void that separates one reality from another. "Why," she asked, "should we not create as we were created? Why should the power of making be forbidden to us who are ourselves made?"

And she learned to sing to fragments and birth life, in her image, from the remnants of divinity.

But the children of Nyxara's art were abominations. Where natural creatures bore warmth, hers knew only cold hunger and malice. Where true life sought harmony, hers craved dissolution. They were mockeries of creation, bearing forms that hurt the eye and purposes that sickened the soul. Her fellow Guardians pleaded with her to cease.

Nyxara heard their words, and hearing, rejected them.

Then Oranthel the Golden, First Among Primarchs and eldest of Elora's children, descended from his place between the stars. He came not in wrath but in sorrow, for Nyxara was sister to him in the truest sense—born of the same shattering, shaped from the same divine essence. Long they contested in the deep places beneath the world, where stone runs like water and fire speaks in tongues.

In the end, Oranthel prevailed, but he could not bring himself to unmake one who shared his origin. Instead, he wrought a prison of pure obsidian, as dark as the void Nyxara so loved, and into this stone he sealed her essence. Deep he buried it, deeper than any would ever delve, and spoke words of binding that would hold until the ending of the world.

Or so he believed.

Where Oranthel planted this seed of imprisonment, a mountain grew. In that mountain laid a vast treasure of mineral and gem. Ages turned. The Celestials withdrew from mortal affairs. Kingdoms rose and fell like waves upon the shore. And in time, men came to the mountain, drawn by veins of silver and gold that ran through its bones like blood.

Thus was Dorgen-Vault born.

For eight hundred years, the city prospered beneath the earth. Its halls echoed with the ring of hammer on anvil, its markets overflowed with treasures drawn from the deep. The miners of Dorgen-Vault were artists of stone and darkness, and their works were coveted from the Sunrise Kingdoms to the Courts of Twilight. They delved ever deeper, following veins of precious metal through the mountain's heart, never knowing they were circling a far more terrible treasure.

Until thirty years ago. Until the Breaking of the Seal.

The miners who found the chamber would later swear they had followed no map, obeyed no foreman's order. Something had called to them through the stone—a song without words, a promise without voice. They broke through into a perfect sphere of polished rock, and at its heart, floating in defiance of all natural law, hung a gem of absolute darkness. The Voidstone, though they knew not its name. Nyxara's prison, though they knew not its purpose.

The first man to touch it fell to his knees and wept with joy. The second began to laugh and could not stop. The third spoke in languages that had been dead since the world was young.

They were the first of the Voidtouched, and they would not be the last.

Nyxara, who had schemed through millennia of imprisonment, poured her whispers through the cracks in her cage. She spoke to the miners of power unlimited, of secrets hidden since the foundation of the world, of the weakness of flesh and the strength that lay beyond it. One by one, they fell to her influence. A cult grew in the shadows of Dorgen-Vault, performing rituals to crack the prison their master could not break from within.

And when the bonds grew weak enough, Nyxara began to create once more.

The Fall of Dorgen-Vault is remembered in the songs of survivors as the Night of Unmaking. The things that crawled from the deep places bore the shapes of men and women, but their movements were those of spiders, their hungers those of the void. Friend turned on friend. Parents devoured children. The city that had stood for eight centuries fell in eight hours, and when the sun rose, only monsters walked its halls.

For thirty years, the ruins have festered like an untended wound - but posed no threat. Yet now, the corruption spreads. War bands march from the mountain's gates with purpose and discipline. Villages burn. Travelers vanish. And those who escape speak of a darkness gathering beneath the stone, of something vast and patient preparing to emerge.

King Aldemar, of the Ardent Line, has sent forth a call. He seeks an Awakened of uncommon power, one who can descend into the mountain's depths and face whatever horror commands the fallen city. To guide this champion he calls upon Thalior, a Guardian who remembers when the world was young, who stood witness when Oranthel pronounced his judgment.

Thalior knows what stirs beneath the great halls of Dorgen-Vault. He knows the Voidstone weakens with each passing season. And he knows that should Nyxara break free entirely, she will remake the world itself, one fragment at a time, until all of Ardenia is filled with her creations.

The last hope of the realm descends into darkness, bearing steel and flame against an enemy older than kingdoms. The Voidstone waits in the deep, patient and hungry.

#### The Awakened
*Of the Gift of Vaelith and the Price of Power*

In the dark days when Nyxara's abominations first crawled from the void, when mortal steel proved worthless against unholy flesh, there came among the people Vaelith the Compassionate, least and kindest of the Guardians. She witnessed humanity's despair, saw children devoured by shadows that wore their parents' faces, and her heart broke within her.

"Behold," she said, "I shall teach you the secret that we Celestials have kept since the Great Shattering. You are born of Elora's fragments, as are we. The difference lies only in degree, not in kind. You may claim more fragments unto yourselves, if you dare pay the price."

Thus began the First Awakening.

To absorb a fragment is to invite a war within one's very soul. The body falls into the Sleep of Trials, a coma so deep that breath itself becomes uncertain. In this state, the fragment and the mortal essence contest for dominion. Most who attempt the joining die within three days, their bodies consuming themselves from within. Others emerge broken in mind, screaming prophecies in tongues that predate speech, their sanity shattered by visions of the void. These mad ones must be given the mercy of steel, lest they become vessels for horrors worse than death.

Yet some—precious few—emerge triumphant. These are the Awakened, and they bear within themselves the fire of creation itself. Their bodies know strength beyond mortal limits. Their minds can shape reality through will alone, channeling the fragment's power as what lesser folk call magic. Most wonderous of all: they can continue to grow, absorbing more fragments, ascending ever closer to the divine.

The young prove most adaptable to the Awakening, their souls still malleable, not yet hardened by the weight of years. Among adults, perhaps one in twenty survives the process intact. Among those who have seen fewer than twenty winters, the odds improve to one in five. Still terrible, yet against Nyxara's hordes, even terrible odds seemed a blessing.

And so the Awakened became Ardenia's answer to the darkness—mortals who had touched divinity and lived, who could match the void-born horror for horror, strength for strength. They alone could face the spawn of Nyxara and prevail, for they wielded the same fundamental force that gave such creatures life.

In this age, as shadows gather once more beneath Khaz Dromar, the Awakened stand as humanity's brightest hope and darkest gamble. For power always demands a price, and the line between savior and monster grows thinner with each fragment absorbed.
