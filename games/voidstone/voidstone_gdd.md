## Story Overview
### Backstory
In the beginning, there was Elora, a Worldseed sent by the creator to a barren planet. When she arrived, she shattered herself to form the world of Ardenia. The power released created all life - but not all of her was used. Some fragments survived. Her largest fragments became the Celestials, a group of sentient, immensely powerful beings who shaped the lands and skies. These Celestials are divided into three tiers: the most powerful are the Primarchs who govern cosmic forces, the next are the Shapers who craft the physical world, and then the Guardians who walk among mortals as guides and protectors.

When Elora shattered, many smaller fragments, like specs of dust, were scattered across creation. They gave rise to the great beasts of legend: dragons soaring through mountain ranges, the mighty krakens lurking in oceanic depths, and other formidable creatures of extraordinary intelligence and power.

Among the Guardians was Nyxara, whose curiosity led her to experiment with the void between realities. Her obsession grew as she discovered she could use fragments to create life in her image, though her creations emerged twisted and malevolent. Despite warnings from the Celestials, Nyxara persisted until Oranthel, leader of the Primarchs, was sent to intervene. He imprisoned her essence within a stone and buried her deep. The stone became a mountain seed, and a great mountain grew over her as a seal.

Centuries passed, and the mountain, rich with mineral wealth, attracted miners who established the underground city of Dorgen-Vault. For generations, it flourished as a marvel of engineering and craft, with sprawling districts, massive foundries, and networks of mines delving ever deeper. The inhabitants grew wealthy, and their city became renowned throughout Ardenia.

Thirty years ago, miners breached a sealed chamber and discovered a mesmerizing dark gem. Those who gazed upon it heard whispers promising power and knowledge. Slowly, the whispers turned to commands as Nyxara, now known only as the Spirit of Void, possessed the miners. Under her influence, they formed a cult that performed rituals to weaken her prison.

As her power grew, Nyxara created monstrous beings from fragments, unleashing them upon Dorgen-Vault's unsuspecting populace. The city fell in a single night of terror, forcing survivors to flee to the surface. The few who escaped told tales of friends and family transformed into mindless servants of the Voidstone.

In the decades since, the abandoned metropolis has become a nest of aberrations. Recently, organized raiding parties of these creatures have begun terrorizing nearby settlements, suggesting a coordinated intelligence directing them — and a far greater threat looming on the horizon.

King Aldemar assembled a team of six Awakened, tasked with reclaiming Dorgen-Vault and eliminating the source of the monsters. Accompanying them is Thalior, a Guardian who believes the stone the miners uncovered is the Voidstone, Nyxara's prison, and it must be resealed or destroyed before she is free to rain down catastrophe upon all of Ardenia.

#### The Awakened
Long ago, before Nyxara was imprisioned, while she was activly making her monsters, a guardian showed the people how to absorb fragments. This granted them extraordinary abilities, but not without peril. During the process, the person falls into a deep coma. Most die within a few days, but others awaken insane, in a nightmare state. Very few adults who undergo the process survive, although adolescents have a higher survival rate. Those who successfully integrate with a fragment and awaken sane are called Awakened, and they possess enhanced strength, resilience, and the ability to channel the fragment's power as magic. Those who wake insane are executed immediately for the safety of all.

The Awakened possess the ability to absorb more fragments to grow their strength far beyond normal humans. This gave the people of Ardenia a means of fighting back against the monstrous creations of Nyxara.

## Gameplay
In Voidstone, players command a party of six adventurers through a sprawling subterranean metropolis using first-person, grid-based movement. The heart of gameplay revolves around strategic party management with permanent death consequences. Invested fragments can be recovered from fallen heroes, and replacement party members can be recruited at the City Hub. Combat unfolds through turn-based tactical battles where positioning, initiative, and action economy drive strategic decisions. As players defeat monsters, they collect fragments to invest in a classless progression system, allowing complete freedom in character development across various skill trees including combat abilities and magical schools.

The journey through Voidstone's depths features zone-based difficulty progression, environmental puzzles, and hidden secrets waiting to be discovered. Players will manage a shared inventory, craft and enchant equipment, and interact with NPCs through text-based dialogue. The City Hub serves as the central base of operations, where recruitment, crafting, enchanting, and quest management take place as players venture deeper into the mysterious metropolis to confront the force behind the Voidstone.
