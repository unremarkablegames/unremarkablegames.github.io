## The Documents for Neon Labyrinth

As with anything else in the tech world, there seems to be a lot of paperwork involved when trying to do something useful.

The following is a list of documents I will be writing during pre-production, in roughly the order they are listed. These are live documents, so if you want to know when they are updated, subscribe to our weekly update on the [Unremarkable Games](https://unremarkablegames.substack.com) Substack, or join the conversation in the [dev channel](https://discord.com/channels/1263683765406924943/1263683837196505201) of our Discord server.
